Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality

A little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me
Mama, just killed a man

Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come
